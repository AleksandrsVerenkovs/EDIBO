In crude way Internet is - physical collection of routers and circuits as a set of shared resources

All the resources and users on the Internet that are using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. This is the language in which we write web pages for any Website.

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, and is used to specify addresses on the World Wide Web.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services,
or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.

DNS translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying
computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.

The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for:
 - Start of Authority (SOA),
 - IP addresses (A and AAAA),
 - SMTP mail exchangers (MX),
 - name servers (NS),
 - pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), 
 - domain name aliases (CNAME).

## Hosting types.

1. Shared Hosting - website will be stored on the same server as multiple other websites
	            all domains share the same server resources, such as RAM and CPU
2. Virtual private server (VPS) hosting - A VPS hosting plan is the ultimate middle ground between a shared server
					  and a dedicated server. theyâ€™re still not able to handle incredibly high
					  traffic levels or spikes in usage
3. Dedicated server hosting - you have full root and admin access. However, one of the most expensive web hosting
		              options. high level of technical expertise is required for the installation and ongoing
			      management of the server.
4. Cloud hosting - 

5. Managed hosting - 

6. Colocation - 

SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Server.
This server takes care of delivering emails from one server to another server.
